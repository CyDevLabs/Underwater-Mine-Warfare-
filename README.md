training an autoencoder on a single image may not yield useful results as the model may simply learn to memorize the input image without extracting useful features. It's usually better to use a dataset of multiple images to train the autoencoder.

The batch size is a hyperparameter in machine learning that refers to the number of samples used in one iteration of training a neural network.
