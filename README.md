Deep Learning applied to Underwater Mine Warfare


**Google Colab using Tensorflow**

training an autoencoder on a single image may not yield useful results as the model may simply learn to memorize the input image without extracting useful features. It's usually better to use a dataset of multiple images to train the autoencoder.

The batch size is a hyperparameter in machine learning that refers to the number of samples used in one iteration of training a neural network. 

**Results**
TensorFlow was able to find 8 images in training dataset, 2 images in your validation dataset, and 2 images in your test dataset, and that the images belong to 2 different classes.
